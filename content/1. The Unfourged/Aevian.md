## $\quad$Backstory
There was a once a couple of wanderers, or travellers, maybe adventurers, explorers, you name it. Their names were [[Arnald Felwood]], and [[Sabine Greenfield]]. Said couple loved each other as much as they did investigating ancient ruins, studying old manuscripts and researching about long-gone civilizations. They didn’t really care about having a place to stay the night, nor did they care about having a place to call home. Sure, they had set up their main base in Mulrogh, but it’s not like they worried about getting back there as soon as possible.

They had been to countless places, and in one of those, they found a manuscript that led to a sort of dungeon in which there was hidden a rare artefact, apparently sought after many treasure hunters. Needless to say, it was more than enough for this couple to set foot almost immediately after hearing about it. At first, Arnald was concerned about Sabine, since they had been planning on having a kid, but she was perfectly okay and One could say they weren’t as patient as the situation required in terms of deeply researching about the place as they were rather blinded by greed. They were seasoned adventurers after all, so all they needed to be was cautious not to bump into many bandits or ambushes. But that would be the least of their problems.

After several days of figuring out the puzzles while trying to get rid of unwanted visitors and caring about not running out of food, they managed to reach the chamber where the ancient artefact was kept locked. They opened the huge stone gate, but they did nothing but feeling disappointed for what it seemed to be an empty room. However, as Sabine put a step into the pitch-dark room, a bright blue light was lit up in the middle. It was calming and rewarding, but a couple of seconds later, a gust of wind burst the door open and dragged the woman flying to the centre. Arnald tried to grab his partner by the arm, but all he could manage to do was holding her hand for a split of a second. Sabine was sucked deep into the light until it was impossible to keep looking at it, as it was far too bright. As the seconds passed, and the wind faded out, the room became peaceful and the walls began to lighten in a soft, calming green.

Sabine was lying on the floor, seemingly unconscious. Arnald ran up to her and pulled her towards his chest. He didn’t really paid attention to the fact that she was lighter than usual, all he cared about was keeping her safe. After about a minute, Sabine opened her eyes and everything was fine. She didn’t remember what happened so Arnald told her as she calmed him. As expected, they both got rather scared of that place and were scared about what could happen next, so they got out of there and returned “home”.

Months go by and the couple forgets about “the incident” as apparently they were completely fine and hadn’t noticed anything strange. Until, of course, Sabine had to give birth to her baby. Both were really excited to educate and raise him to be an adventurer like them. However, it only took them a few weeks to tell something was not quite right. It was their baby. He wasn’t human. Sabine had given birth to a ghenasi, an air ghenasi to be precise. Arnald couldn’t really stand his child having elemental powers. Why not him? He was the one who had dedicated his whole life to studying, adventuring and exploring? He wanted that for himself. And his son, Aevin, had took it from him. What if he hadn’t met Sabine? He could’ve been the one and only stepping into that chamber and getting elemental powers. Those were his thoughts. And so, one night he set off to the ruins with the idea of getting air control capabilities. Or at least that’s what the note he left behind to Sabine said.

Arnald didn’t return. Ever. Sabine had to take care of Aevin, feed him, educate him, everything. She didn’t have any regrets, she loved her son more than anything, even more than that moron who left them blinded by greed, again. But that didn’t really last for long. Naturally, the news spread really quick that Sabine, the kind of well-known explorer, had given birth to an air ghenasi. Of course that really caught the attention of several different groups of bounty hunters, mercenaries, and many other non-pleasing groups. Sabine had noticed that, and so she planned on leaving anywhere far away from them. 

Little did she know, a group of bandits, [[The Brass Borns]], broke in her house to kidnap Aevian. Sabine tried as hard as she could not to let them take the kid, but she ultimately failed. The 4-year-old ghenasi was taken away from his mum in a brutal assault to his home.

Aevian was trained and raised by [[The Brass Borns]] to be used as a ‘weapon’. They pretty much brainwashed so he didn’t missed his mum or cared to look for her. He thought they were his family. However as he grew older, he realised he had no one to look up to, no friends, no purpose in life. He started to question what he was meant to do, who should he care about, since (the kidnappers) only wanted him for his potential.

And so, when Aevian turned 17 he decides there’s no point on being with [[The Brass Borns]]. They took away his whole life, and he’s not more than a mere ‘weapon’. He wanted revenge; they deserved to die. Then be it. He ended the life of each and every man using the skills they taught him and left to roam the world, looking to find his parents (or at least find out if they’re still alive).
