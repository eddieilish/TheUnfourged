A harbour town southwest of [[Bombelwind]]. Home to numerous races, Val'eda is the place where the Unfourged meet Lady Lima for the first time.

# Historical events
## The flooding
Shortly after the Unfourged battled against [[The Dragon]], earthquakes began to hit the continent of Bombelwind. These events along with the mention of [[Operation Lizard]] make the party revisit the place. As the aircraft approached the region, nothing but a few mountain peaks could be seen above a giant sea, where once Val'eda stood upon. 

There, the Unfourged rush underwater looking for [[Lady Lima]], only to find her shop occupied by elemental beings. After a tedious fight, Yhara notices a robotic head floating away from its original body, that promptly recognises as [[Dori]]'s.
