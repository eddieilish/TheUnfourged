# Vaatu, prince of Parala
## Description
Vaatu is deeply motivated by his quest to regain his honour. He has been banished from his kingdom due to an attack that occurred on the Cephlopod researchers, which he was in charge of protecting as prince and head of the military. Many lives and important research were lost, and he was banished from the kingdom and to never come back until he regained his honour. The attackers and the reason behind it still remain a mystery. He now roams the surface land in search of the attackers as his last hope to come back home (although that may not be what he tells strangers at first, he will probably say he’s an emissary of the underwater kingdom on a very important mission)

## Biography
Vaatu has been raised in the underwater palace of Parala by [[King Agledu]] and [[Queen Shaizess]], along with his younger sister [[Mirana]]. He’s had good relationship with them throughout his entire life up to his banishment when he brought shame to the family.

Due to his royal upbringing, he is acquainted with formal protocol and has received formal military training (thus its fighter class) as advanced education. But on the other hand, he is a bit full of himself and lived with the constant burden of responsibility.
## Relationships
### Allies
- His sister [[Mirana]] (see picture above along with their parents), she was sad to see him leave and doesn’t blame him for the attack.
- [[Atchulu]], his old mentor who’s thought him everything since he was a child (see picture above along with his family), he treats him like his own son.
- Probably other surface royal families or nobility not in direct proximity to Parala, which may not have heard the latest news that Vaatu has been banished, and may still give him the prince treatment and help him out wherever he goes.
- His pet wale, [[Lunala]], that used to take him everywhere. He hasn’t seen her since the banishment.
- His exboyfriend [[Flymrynn]]. Not technically an “exboyfriend”, he is a wood-elf from a noble family from Ilphanhain who used to have… good relations with him (tritons and elves have good diplomatic relations with each other because of mutual respect and similar physical traits like their slow-aging and elegance AKA they both are a bit full of themselves). They finished things years ago but they are sort of in good terms with each other? Although Vaatu was sort of an asshole with him??
### Enemies
- The attackers of Parala.
- Some [[Cephlopods]] politicians in the Council who seek to weaken his family’s power and strengthen the Council’s, and thus voted strongly in favour of his banishment.
