## Prologue
At [[Boldar]], a small village in the [[Kingdom of Bombelwind]], which has mainly dwarves and halflings as population (this kingdom was defeated in war by the Elves centuries ago and even though they’re at peace now, they still have to regularly pay a lot of taxes), our heroes meet for the first time:
- [[Vaatu]]: Triton Prince of [[Parala]] (underwater city), banished due to a terrorist attack, trying to regain his honour.
- [[Thaia]]: Centaur warrior in search of her tribe, [[The Korassi]] (last time anybody saw a centaur was 100 years ago).
- [[Yhara]]: Fallen aasimar trying to find out why she one day suddenly fell.
- [[Aevian]]: Air genashi kidnapped and raised by [[The Brass Borns]], a group of bandits.

We were asked for help by the villagers, since they’re being attacked by a pack of magical and very intelligent wolves. [[Brenise]] joins us after one of these attacks injured her father. We finally find the cave where the wolves are and realise they have a human pre-existence (Brenise took their corpses to the capital to analyse them at a temple), killed them and liberated the villagers. Vaatu took his chance adopted a pair of twin puppies from the lair, which he named [[Milo & Finn]] (==safely kept in a bracelet/poke-ball==* *this happens later, to be rearranged*). During the looting process, we also got a really handy [[Portable hole]]. Later on, celebrating the victory in the tavern, Yahra charms a female halfling in an attempt to prank Vaatu, but she ends up sleeping with her.
# Chapter I. Welcome to Bombelwind
## Act I. The Howling Caves
Once we were done in this village, Yahra had visions about [[Vogdorth]] (one of the rich Dwarf cities in twin peaks), so we decided to go there. However, on the way there we are attacked by [[Aranil]] and Yahra confesses that he is part of [[The Duskstriders]], a group of fallen aasimar assassins who have been trying to recruit her.

We finally reached Vogdorth: Aevian bought a map of some cave at an antique shop and Thaia argued with him about taxes (quote: What are taxes?). We managed to get an audience with the [[King of Vogdorth|King]] (Vaatu said he was in a diplomatic mission, but the princess [[Princess Doldrebela|Doldrebela]] already knew he was lying). Unfortunately, the King was assassinated shortly after our audience by the Dusk Striders (group of fallen aasimar assassins) and we were framed for it. We learn that Yahra’s vision was caused due to a ritual from whoever hired the Dusk Striders, because somehow she was a part of it as well, and [[Fhaelor]] (one of the Dusk Striders) tries recruiting her.

After the assasination, the city had a total lockdown but we were helped by the [[Cemu Cemuphnil]], the King’s Court Wizard, who believed in our innocence and also wanted to escape the city. We had to fight our way through [[Princess Doldrebela|Doldrebela]] and we manage to escape the city kinda stealthely with Thaia floating like a balloon, putting us in the bag-hole and tying it to her axe and throwing it out of the city gates. A bounty was placed on our head (later paid off by the Elven prince).

We decided to follow Aevian’s map to [[The Howling Caves]] in the outskirts of Vogdorth and explore its tunnels: we find Aevian’s father’s corpse ([[Arnald Felwood]]) and Aevian also has a vision there of [[Akadi|Akadi, the Queen of Air]]: she told him she was the protector of the shard of the [[Betrayer God]] and she almost killed his parents while exploring the tunnels but took pity on them because [[Sabine Greenfield]] was pregnant.

There were a couple of ice elementals that killed Cemu but we were aided by [[Flymrynn]] (Vaatu’s exboyfriend) and [[Phteven]]. They happened to be there because these ruins in the tunnels have some connection to [[Gruumsh the Ruiner]] (Thaia finds out that she already has a shard of him inside which was why she bled tears of blood of her from a vision given by a hag that brought her back to life). In this cave there should be one of Gruumsh’s 3 [[Shards of the Betrayer God|shards]], but apparently the shard that should have been there was already stolen by the [[Cephlopods]] (the other species that coinhabits Parala and apparently orchestrated the terrorist attack that got Vaatu banished). Thaia also finds an amulet of scrying (which allows to spy on somebody once a day).

We accidentally activate a trap and the tunnels get rapidly filled with water, but Yahra manages to reduce the locked gates of the cave and later return them to their original size so we can escape and not drown. Flymrynn leaves for [[Ilphenheim]] to inform the Elves after gifting us a ring to breathe underwater (and after kissing Vaatu goodbye), so we decide to go back into the tunnel to examine a mysterious egg, which upon lifting it, opens a tunnel that takes us all the way to the ocean.
## Act II. The underwater city
![|400](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/EUQrj9nrrkK0E1mIk0OL-Laa7vyCClnAu1NSzzVATVOKlMOks-nwZELSspsuiXmMEYVW6hkauorqowIgC1rXEoQTI1wvYMWcn6CMl1rH2W6ZTm7wkE5eGz3pNbwy3rfGNWvHu-hjGjNOq6owN8sNyto)

We make our way to [[Parala]] to find out what is going on and warn the Royal Family of the soon-to-be uprising of the Cephlopods. Since Vaatu is still banished, we hide in an old shipwreck in the outskirts (fun anecdote: we try to teach Thaia how to write her own name… unsuccessfully) until [[Atchulu]] sneaks them in the city, where they meet up with [[Mirana]] and [[Metrifa]].

Together, they make their way into the cephlopods’ headquarters to stop them from bringing back [[Alphea]] (abyssal jellyfish and daughter of Gruumsh). When we barely defeat them (EPIC BATTLE BTW), as Thaia delivers the final blow, the second shard enters her and she multiclasses to cleric. They are declared heroes of Parala, invited to the Royal Palace and Vaatu is unbanished (yaay!) and they get a lot of moneymoneymoneyyyy.

## Act III.  Awakening
Now that these issues are solved in Parala, we decide to travel to [[Val'Eda]] (human city of elven past by the Bombelwind coast) because Yahra wanted to check on her friends + Thaia’s vision during her trance at the Cehplopods headquarters said there was a sacred place of her tribe closeby. We mount [[Lunala]] (Vaatu’s whale) to land. Once on land, while on our way across Bombelwind, near Bombelfeld (capital of Bombelwind), we get attacked by an [[Dao, the earth bitch]] that wants to capture Aevian and take him to the earth elemental plane (we manage to defeat her).

![|600](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ObDokXxedG3z1WrWUtadxfJf6Waaznem2RTuZ7A46zniGguR2kyExbCKEBjTOXPpFeRM2KIlT8Cr952-04vAYwYnGJTpBKzahVOJhUDIiZi9igerYCYisJOZj39PsoWEroEgxGWW8ArLtbN9cNNJ6vM)
On the second half of the trip to Val’Eda we have to go by sea, so we arrive at a fishing village (in which there was a potion gnome with a sidequest we ignored) to find a ship. We finally join some pirates (quote of one of the pirates waking up Vaatu and Yahra sleeping in the same hammock: “prince and… princess?” *Yahra is in shock and Vaatu falls*). [[Captain Prookfoot]] tells us about his “adopted son” [[Nesbor]], a water genasi who, like Aevian, was attacked by an elemental.

![|400](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/kJXLCrfcRkJK1_DhApU2WZNcGgDa1W_n0RswvDKN9MGMJAlK6uFoXV1sZlhG_dA5uKPuXa0bcPdsNN5_-or9ox7yXhxQN9-qPL0ux9_gQ2cYOIZmCDzGbMExqz6pcefboMPXemciQM6F-h2dka8lEIM)

Speaking of attacks: we get attacked by some cephlopds on giant octopus, Aevian releases spores that get Vaatu confused and somehow everybody but him ends up overboard. At some point Vaatu is almost killed but magically receives the Wavebreaker Trident through a vision of his dad telling him about [[Persana]] and kills off the dark mage cephlopod (epic battle ngl).!

They drop us off on land (mainly because Thaia keeps complaining about being in the water) and get attacked ONCE MORE by [[Aranil]] who AGAIN tries to recruit Yahra and gives her a [[Shadoweye]] (allows her to see invisibility) as an incentive of the powers she could get if she joins them.

![|400](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/HA3qhjZ3GMBntz2rV22ceXJV8ybl8JRj-0g_KKNnHqtFIV5Rpv0d48nMNC7ECOj8Dv0522bjZcJ7x8UjyOuv1MY-NU8xhdvWlIfQcbVWc6FljY05vXj6L2wpGfTPAMt2dx0g7imC9RcBkTO0DyRONhY)

We finally reach Val’Eda and meet Yahra’s tiefling friends ([[Kriella]] and [[Makaria]]) who took her in when she was kicked out of her aasimar village. Yahra is happy to rejoin Kriella and Thaia is just happy to sip on their home-made tea. However, Makaria is acting like a lil’ punk and is hanging out with the wanna-be-gangster kids of Val’Eda, so Yahra helps Kriella look for her and put some sense in her head. After that happy reunion (and more tea to keep Thaia satisfied), Kriella offers to guide us outside of the city on our way to the forest where supposedly the centaurs are. On the way there, we are attacked by some dwarves trying to hunt us for the bounty Princess Dordrebela placed on our heads (spoiler alert: they are the ones who lose their heads).

![|400](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Q-aFknEx2iyqK61SJklxq_sbdOSewiILzrYLAe9dLw1YcStY_Yb14X1z3ZJkzPTk5z1oo5j7O9KVAnN6IBce_UYzuHVSxX_FwLRNh5ECpTyEyerSnmEXIFPAoQ0uOZ7R4hddCiJ70PizEEyDvObvYJw)

We travel to said dark forest, in which we are continuously harassed by [[Odilia]], the female Duskstrider, until we finally manage to kill her. In the depths of the forest we find a vine dome with petrified centaurs and manage to revivify [[Thimiopis]] (Thaia’s friend) with help of [[Lady Lima]] once back in her magic workshop in Val’Eda. Vaatu and Yahra also get rid of Odilia’s corpse throwing it over a cliff while weirdly having a romantic moment looking at the moon over the sea. At some point Vaatu also bought bracers of defense from Lady Lima and gifted them to Yahra.

However, we are arrested on sight in Val’Eda by [[Isadora Braag]] the Mythril Commander because apparently while we were out, a dragon asked for our heads or otherwise he’d destroy the city. We travel to a mountain far away so that the citizens have time to flee (also Thimiopis because she’s still in a very weak state), and we fight [[Azzacrotzz]] The Sizzling Death and the Dusk Striders (apparently they both worked together for [[The Unfothomable]] who wants the shards: the 3rd shard was inside [[The Wildmother’s Embrace]], giant tree in Val’Eda, which the Dusk Striders managed to steal).

We are aided by [[Lady Lima]] and [[Voldria]] (Yahra’s aasimar friend/sister), who arrives on her giant eagle (later killed). EPIC BATTLE in which we knock out [[Fhaelor]] (leader of the Dusk Striders) and Aranil (and learn they have their base somewhere in Ilphenheim) and Vaatu takes on the Dragon by himself, seriously damaging him and blinding him of one eye.

At some point in the fight Thaia absorbs the 3rd shard and, now having all 3 of them, she duplicates herself into the [[Nightmare]] (and loses her cleric multiclass in the process). This fight is too much for our heroes and, in her final breath, Lady Lima transforms into a bronze dragon and teleports them to [[Ilphenheim]] (Elven kingdom) telling us to ask Dory about “[[Protocol Fallen Lizard]]”.
## Act IV. Operation fallen lizard
We were dead for a month recovering in [[Inkalille]] (capital of Ilphenheim) and during that time talked with [[Korellon]] (Elven god). He tells Yahra that she has a spark of [[Avandra, the changebringer]] in her and she should look for a temple of her deity because she may be able to turn back to regular aasimar.

![|400](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/KRFSy5thKybe_qLOBwuqzEzkMxJQ0BZsKzsP4Sw0u_ar_mO9Kr33b7zwv1Aig4XqhcMeApdipxVGxa2gr7sEnjTdkc51Vo8Jq4Bhk35wLxvuMh_PxCS6W8f194lZ98FM14_6Ms3oMtVj85-U2TagpJw)

Once we woke up, Vaatu had beef with Flymrynn because he hooked up with his sister Mirana. They talked things out and now it’s kinda solved because they’re serious and he’s not fooling around. On the fun side: Yahra catches Vaatu in the bathtub and she’s not a shy lady. They all have a shopping day in which they buy gala outfits to have an audience with the Elven Imperial Family: the [[Elven princess]] seems a bit shady because whe wanted to use the weak situation of Bombelfeld to reestablish their power.


Later on [[Prince Aeson]] (also close friend of Flymrynn’s) went behind her back to talk with us in a tavern. We split: Voldria and Flymrynn decide to look for the Dusk Striders base in Ilphenheim, Mirana goes back to Parala ([[King Agledu]] is acting weird now so Princess Mirana and [[Queen Shaizess]] are managing the Kingdom while the King has locked himself up in his chambers) and we decide to go back to Val’Eda to look for Dory the robot (Lady Lima’s assistant to find more about her) + [[Aeson]] and Flymrynn also asked us to investigate what is going on in Bombelwind, because Aeson’s informants have heard rumours that something is going on.
![|400](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/AgkNcFQnqcfML78Urk_DeDVHSOkxbFWWPI__9SmSeMHK1fGhnSmhTvYdAHh5fBydPPbWaRvfoQIeRntp54f68RnR0ObsAhjdgh6CzvBhlz7C6dM8l26kuUkho-14zBZnrBzm1H2Mv4I7wW1qqRIWvPM)

We go back to [[Val'Eda]] by aircraft (we are attacked by flying demons on the way, EPIC BATTLE) and from up in the air we see that somehow now half of Bombelwind is sunken and attacked by elementals and demons. Once at where Val’Eda used to be, we dive underwater and try to recover the pieces of Dory in Lady Lima’s workshop to uncover what “Protocol Fallen Lizard” is.

![|400](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/DWdwvPP9A4vxW4JSjTi32TbpK3ya1oFS5LwOWwwvSfJqvP3XI05xyC7DYqBqeQnROJ2TCaUaUod2MjtXF72_JfXKaZN8yXZLnb2ZDivA2-0wc8y7MijY5pJRuNhe4H9xhP6UFknSIKfCBVMEDrGsk_s)

We are attacked by elementals and aided by [[Nesbor]] the water genashi (Yahra multiclasses to rogue). We find some of the the refugees of Val’Eda and the archdruid under the roots of the giant tree and with Lunala take them back to the surface. While we wait for Lunala, Aevian has another vision of the Akadi the Queen of Air: he and Nesbor are [[Enkits]], children of elemental gods, whose existance is forbidden and that’s why they’re being chased by earth-elementals to be killed (Nesbor still has to try to contact his water-god-parent, maybe at a temple in Parala). She also tells Aevian we should go to the air plane (she’s gonna give us powers).

Once on the surface to deliver the refugees, there was a battle and we join [[Thimiopis]]. We are also on the way to Parala because Mirana messaged Vaatu telepathically that it’s under attack by elementals. We also wanted to go to [[Crystal Crest]] to fix Dory.
