# The Queen of Air

Akadi is one of the primordials (not a god more of a personification of the element) that rule the various elemental planes. She is neutral to the current events taking place in Imminar. 
# Appearances
Akadi has interacted twice with [[Aevian]] to enlighten him about his past.
## The first call
The first appearance Akadi said to Aevian the following words:
>I am Akadi the queen of air. We’ve met before but you haven’t been born yet. I swore to the gods to protect the remnant the shard of a betrayer god but when the sigil was triggered and I was summoned all I saw was a woman that was only driven by curiosity not by evil intent. So I took pity. But I felt that the betrayer god has been wriggling in his cage. Please go back to the place we first met the mortals call it the howling caves. See if you find the shard.
## Reunion
Then, a few months after that, Aevian purposefully tried contacting Akadi in order to get knowledge about the elemental situation in [[Val'Eda]]. The insight went as it follows:
> Last time falling. Not now, I’m floating. Aether, my son.
> Selum anc Xar created the elemntal plantes, fire, earth, water, air
> War of elemental creations (enkits)
> Akadi has basically told me Im an Enkit, which are the people granted elemental powers by the gods of planes. There was once a war to achieve said powers and since then, the war was ceased to an agreement of not creating more Enkits. I was created out of pure pity since Akadi was about to kill my mother, but spared her and my life, by granting me “Enkit” powers. Earth and Water planes are seeking me to destroy me, since I’m forbidden, but they may or may not know about Nesbor. The [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] and the [[Kossuth]] the Fire Lord don't seem to be involved at all.
> Nesbor is an Enkit.
